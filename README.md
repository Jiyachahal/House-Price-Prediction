# House-Price-Prediction
The House Price Prediction Project predicts house prices using regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting. It analyzes features such as income, house age, and area population. With training accuracy up to 93%, it optimizes price predictions for real estate analysis.

This project predicts house prices based on features like income, house age, number of rooms, and area population. Regression models are used to provide accurate price predictions.

## Overview

The project involves:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers.
- **EDA**: Exploring data distributions and relationships.
- **Model Training**: Using Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation**: Comparing models based on accuracy and error metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset `USA_Housing.csv` contains features related to income, house details, and population. It includes 5,000 samples and is used to train and test regression models.

## Results

- **Linear Regression**: Training accuracy of 92% and test accuracy of 92%.
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: Training accuracy of 92%, test accuracy of 78%.
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: Training accuracy of 93%, test accuracy of 91%.
